Here's a breakdown of the global execution context in JavaScript:

1. Variable Environment: This component stores all the variables and function declarations in your code.

2. Lexical Environment: It keeps track of the scope chain and the value of the 'this' keyword.

3. Scope Chain: It determines the accessibility of variables and functions in your code. When you reference a variable, JavaScript searches for it in the current scope and then moves up the scope chain until it finds the variable or reaches the global scope.

4. 'this' keyword: It refers to the object that the current code is being executed within. Its value is determined by how a function is called.

5. Creation Phase: During this phase, JavaScript sets up the global execution context by creating the Variable Environment and Lexical Environment.

6. Execution Phase: Once the creation phase is complete, JavaScript starts executing the code line by line within the global execution context.
