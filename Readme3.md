DOM manipulation involves using JavaScript to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) of a webpage. This allows you to add, remove, or modify elements on the page, change styles, and respond to user interactions. It's like having the power to dynamically update and customize the webpage based on user actions or other events.
An example of DOM manipulation could be changing the text of a paragraph on a webpage when a button is clicked. This involves accessing the paragraph element in the DOM using JavaScript and then updating its content based on the button click event. It's like making the webpage react to user actions in real time!
