Difference  step by step:

1. JavaScript: JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language that is primarily used for client-side web development. It allows you to add interactivity and functionality to web pages. You can use JavaScript to manipulate HTML elements, handle events, perform calculations, and much more.

2. TypeScript: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means it includes all the features of JavaScript and adds some additional ones. The main difference is that TypeScript introduces static typing. This means that you can explicitly declare variable types, function parameter types, and return types. TypeScript also supports features like interfaces, classes, and modules, allowing you to write more structured and maintainable code.

3. Type Checking: One of the key benefits of TypeScript is its type checking feature. With TypeScript, you can catch potential errors during development by specifying the expected types of variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps to improve code quality and reduce bugs.

4. Compilation: TypeScript code needs to be compiled into JavaScript before it can be executed in a web browser. The TypeScript compiler (tsc) converts TypeScript code into JavaScript code, which can then be run on any JavaScript runtime environment.

5. Tooling and IDE Support: TypeScript has excellent tooling and IDE support. Many popular code editors like Visual Studio Code provide features like code completion, type inference, and error checking specific to TypeScript. This can greatly enhance your development experience and productivity.
